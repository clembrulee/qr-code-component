## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I set the QR code image to a fixed width and then stylized the container around it. I aligned the items with flexbox. 

```css
.container {
  width: 300px;
  height: auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 30vh auto;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 25px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Through this challenge, I identified that I need to refine my CSS positioning techniques.
